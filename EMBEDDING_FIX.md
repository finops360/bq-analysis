# Fixing Ollama Embedding Issues

This document explains how we've addressed issues with Ollama's embedding functionality.

## The Problem

The BigQuery Optimizer originally required both Ollama (for LLM analysis) and Quadrant (for vector storage), with an expectation that Ollama supported embeddings through its API. However, we discovered that some Ollama installations don't properly support the embeddings API, causing errors like:

```
Error getting embedding from Ollama: Extra data: line 2 column 1 (char 90)
```

## The Solution

We've implemented a robust fallback approach that allows the BigQuery Optimizer to work without requiring the Quadrant vector database or Ollama's embedding functionality.

### Two-Tier Embedding Generation

1. **LLM-Summary Approach**:
   - We send the text to Ollama requesting a summary
   - We use the summary to generate a deterministic embedding
   - This creates semantically-aware embeddings without requiring a dedicated embeddings API

2. **Hash-Based Fallback**:
   - If the LLM-based approach fails, we use a deterministic hash-based embedding
   - This ensures we always have a valid embedding, even if Ollama's API is limited

### Default Configuration Changes

- The default configuration now skips the vector database step (`--skip-vector-db`) 
- This means the tool will work out-of-the-box with any Ollama installation
- Users who have a full Quadrant setup can still use it by removing the `--skip-vector-db` flag

## How to Test Your Setup

1. Use the included `test_ollama.sh` script to verify Ollama API connectivity:
   ```bash
   ./test_ollama.sh
   ```

2. Use the included `test_embeddings.py` script to test the embedding generation:
   ```bash
   python test_embeddings.py
   ```

## Usage

No configuration changes are needed to use the BigQuery Optimizer with the new embedding approach. Simply run:

```bash
./run_analysis.sh
```

The script will automatically detect and use the appropriate embedding method based on your setup.
