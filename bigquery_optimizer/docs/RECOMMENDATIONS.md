# BigQuery Optimization Recommendations

This document provides an overview of the optimization recommendations generated by the BigQuery optimization analyzer.

## Recommendation Types

The analyzer generates several types of optimization recommendations for BigQuery tables:

### 1. Partitioning Recommendations

Partitioning divides tables into segments, making it easier to query and manage your data. The analyzer identifies tables that could benefit from partitioning and suggests the most appropriate columns to use.

**Benefits:**
- Reduced query costs by scanning only relevant partitions
- Improved query performance
- More efficient data lifecycle management

**Example SQL:**
```sql
-- To partition a table on a date column:
CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.table_partitioned`
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_date)
AS SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table`;

-- Then drop the old table and rename the new one:
DROP TABLE `project.dataset.table`;
ALTER TABLE `project.dataset.table_partitioned` RENAME TO `table`;
```

### 2. Clustering Recommendations

Clustering co-locates related data based on the contents of one or more columns. The analyzer identifies good clustering column candidates based on table schema and query patterns.

**Benefits:**
- Improved query performance by reducing data scanned
- Works well with partitioning for compound benefits
- Automatic management by BigQuery (no manual maintenance)

**Example SQL:**
```sql
-- To add clustering to a partitioned table:
CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.table_clustered`
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_date)
CLUSTER BY customer_id, product_id
AS SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table`;

-- Then drop the old table and rename the new one:
DROP TABLE `project.dataset.table`;
ALTER TABLE `project.dataset.table_clustered` RENAME TO `table`;
```

### 3. Combined Partitioning and Clustering

For tables that could benefit from both optimizations, the analyzer provides recommendations that combine partitioning and clustering for maximum efficiency.

**Benefits:**
- Maximum cost optimization and performance improvement
- Ideal for large tables with both time-based access patterns and filtering on specific columns

**Example SQL:**
```sql
-- To add both partitioning and clustering:
CREATE TABLE `project.dataset.table_optimized`
PARTITION BY DATE(transaction_date)
CLUSTER BY customer_id, product_id, region
AS SELECT * FROM `project.dataset.table`;

-- Then drop the old table and rename the new one:
DROP TABLE `project.dataset.table`;
ALTER TABLE `project.dataset.table_optimized` RENAME TO `table`;
```

### 4. Query Optimization Recommendations

For tables that show high scan ratios, the analyzer suggests query pattern improvements to reduce the amount of data processed.

**Benefits:**
- Reduced query costs by scanning less data
- Faster query execution
- More efficient resource utilization

**Implementation:**
- Add filters on columns with high cardinality
- Limit selected columns to only what's needed
- Use approximation functions for large-scale aggregations

### 5. Materialized View Recommendations

For tables that are frequently queried with aggregations, the analyzer suggests creating materialized views to pre-compute common query results.

**Benefits:**
- Dramatic performance improvements for analytical queries
- Reduced processing costs
- Automatic updates when base tables change

**Example SQL:**
```sql
-- Sample materialized view for common aggregation patterns:
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW `project.dataset.table_mv_daily_agg`
AS SELECT
  date_column, category_column,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount,
  AVG(quantity) as avg_quantity
FROM `project.dataset.table`
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing these recommendations:

1. **Test thoroughly** before applying changes to production tables
2. Consider the **query patterns** that access each table
3. Monitor the **impact** of changes to ensure they provide the expected benefits
4. For very large tables, consider creating **new tables** with optimizations rather than modifying existing ones
5. Update any **dependent views or queries** to ensure they continue to work correctly

## Recommendation Priority Levels

Recommendations are prioritized as follows:

- **HIGH**: Significant impact expected, should be implemented as soon as possible
- **MEDIUM**: Moderate impact expected, should be considered for implementation
- **LOW**: Minor impact expected, can be implemented when convenient

The priority is determined based on table size, query frequency, and estimated savings.

## Estimated Savings

Each recommendation includes an estimated savings percentage, which represents the potential reduction in query costs and improvements in performance. These estimates are based on:

- Table size
- Query frequency
- Current versus optimal configuration
- Typical BigQuery optimization benefits

Actual savings may vary based on specific workloads and implementation details.
