# Vector Database Integration Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the BigQuery Optimizer's vector database integration and LLM analysis.

## Recent Fixes (May 14, 2025)

1. **Fixed Quadrant Point ID Format**
   - Now using UUID format for point IDs instead of table IDs with underscores
   - Implemented deterministic UUID generation based on table IDs
   - Added payload search as fallback for retrieving schemas

2. **Enhanced JSON Parsing Robustness**
   - Added multiple fallback methods for parsing LLM responses
   - Implemented more aggressive control character handling
   - Created generic recommendation as final fallback

3. **Improved Empty Table Handling**
   - Added smart handling of missing or empty table references
   - Implemented SQL parsing to extract table names from query text
   - Added validation and filtering for table IDs

4. **Fixed Referenced Tables Variable Scope**
   - Properly passed referenced_tables to extraction methods
   - Ensured table_id is always set in recommendations
   - Added default fallback to "unknown_table" when needed

5. **Added Utility and Testing Tools**
   - Created test_quadrant.py for verifying Quadrant connectivity
   - Added clean_quadrant.py for resetting collections
   - Created test_llm_parser.py for testing recommendation extraction
   - Improved logging for better debugging

## Issues Addressed

1. **JSON Parsing Errors in LLM Responses**
   - Fixed issue with control characters and escaped quotes in JSON responses
   - Implemented robust fallback extraction using regex for malformed JSON

2. **Vector Database Integration**
   - Created a Docker Compose setup for easy Quadrant deployment
   - Improved vector database connection handling
   - Re-enabled vector database by default for optimal schema similarity

3. **Embedding Generation**
   - Enhanced the hybrid approach for generating embeddings:
     - Uses LLM-based summaries to create meaningful embeddings
     - Falls back to deterministic hash-based approach if needed
   - Works with any Ollama installation, with or without embedding API support

## New Features

1. **Docker Integration**
   - Added `docker-compose.yml` for one-command Quadrant setup
   - Created `setup_vectordb.sh` to automate setup and validation

2. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Better handling of JSON parsing errors in LLM responses
   - Graceful degradation when vector database is not available
   - Improved logging for debugging

3. **Flexible Configuration**
   - Use vector database by default for optimal performance
   - Optional `--skip-vector-db` flag for simplified setup

## Usage

1. **Setting Up Vector Database (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Start Quadrant using Docker
   ./setup_vectordb.sh
   
   # Run optimizer with vector database
   ./run_analysis.sh
   ```

2. **Running Without Vector Database**
   ```bash
   # Use fallback embedding approach
   ./run_analysis.sh --skip-vector-db
   ```

## Technical Implementation

### JSON Parsing Enhancement

The LLM analyzer now handles malformed JSON in three ways:
1. Cleaning control characters before parsing
2. Handling escaped quotes and backslashes
3. Using regex extraction for fields when JSON is unparseable

### Embedding Generation

The embedding generation process has been enhanced:
1. Generates a semantic summary of the text using Ollama
2. Creates a hybrid embedding from summary hash and text hash
3. Normalizes vectors for cosine similarity
4. Uses pure hash-based embedding as final fallback

This approach ensures that similar schemas or queries will have similar embeddings, improving the relevance of recommendations.
